# Wrapped Green

this is my first html + css page following this design :
https://xd.adobe.com/view/b1a3be51-1037-4f21-8b01-5b6a9fee0a92-e4f0/grid

i did this project mainly to learn both HTML and CSS
as this is the first page i make, it was fairly challenging for the first time to work with css as it tends to be a bit tricky.
i made it for both desktop and mobile.

fully open for feedback to any change.
